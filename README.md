# MIT-6.0001-Pset-Solutions
My solutions for the Fall 2016 iteration of the five problem sets from MIT 6.0001 - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python.

Pset 1 - 2 programs to determine the number of months to pay off a mortgage and 1 program to find the best possible savings rate using bisection search.

Pset 2 - a program that allows users to play hangman with guesses.

Pset 3 - a program that allows users to play a word game with a scoring system similar to scrabble.

Pset 4 - 1 program that uses recursion to return all possible permutations of the input string, 1 program that uses OOP to implement a Caesar Cipher, and 1 program that uses OOP to implement a Substitution Cipher.

Pset 5 - a program that uses OOP to implement an RSS Feed Filter.
